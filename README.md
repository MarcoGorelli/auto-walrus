A tool and pre-commit hook to automatically apply the awesome walrus operator.


## Installation

```console
pip install auto-walrus
```

## Usage as a pre-commit hook

See [pre-commit](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit) for instructions

Sample `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```yaml
-   repo: https://github.com/MarcoGorelli/auto-walrus
    rev: v0.2.2
    hooks:
    -   id: auto-walrus
```

## Command-line example

```console
auto-walrus myfile.py
```

```diff
-    n = 10
-    if n > 3:
+    if (n := 10) > 3:
         print(n)
```

## Configuration

Using the walrus operator can result in longer lines. Lines longer than what you
pass to ``--line-length`` won't be rewritten to use walrus operators.

E.g.
```
auto-walrus myfile_1.py myfile_2.py --line-length 89
```

Lines with comments won't be rewritten.
